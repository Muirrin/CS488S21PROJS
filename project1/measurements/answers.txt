Q2 Predictions:
RTT: 282 ms
Bandwith: 16 Mbits/sec

Q2 Actual Results:
RTT: 164.635 ms
Bandwith: 18.1 Mbits/sec

Our prediction for RTT while too high, was based on the idea that RTT(round trip time) measures the time it takes to send and recieve a single packet. Because there are more nodes when we ping from h1 to h4, the RTT will be close to the summation of the RTTs of these links. 

For the bandwith, it is the capacity of data that can be sent at a single time in the network. In summary, it is the width of the band :D

Q3 Predictions:
Two pairs: RTT: 164.635 ms

Three pairs: 
RTT: 164.635 ms
 

Q3 Actual Results

RTT: 
2-Pair: 164.439,164.165
3-Pair: 165.455,165.539,164.779
It is traveling the same path as in question 2 with the same nodes/links, therefore should stay approximately the same. This applies to both 2 and 3 pairs of hosts.

Q4 Predictions:
RTT: 164 ms, 200 ms 
They have the same number of nodes but the time of h5 to h6 will increase because of overlap in Link2. 

Q4 Actual Results: 
RTT: 164.821 ms, 44.619 ms
Each link has a different latency, which means that even though they have the same amount of nodes, RTT will be different as they only share L2.
